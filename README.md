# Lets-camp

Camping should be made easier with weather information, camp parking information, and an overall community board that may have already been to those campsites!

This camping app aims at promoting good consumer preparation before they even set foot in a campsite. Use our app to look for weather information and to find useful bits about your next potential camping experience! 

To start:
1. Clone
2. npm run start
3. Enjoy!

Team Squirtle.
Good luck!
